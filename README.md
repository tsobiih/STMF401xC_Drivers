# ARM Cortex-M4 Drivers (Work in Progress)

This repository contains a collection of drivers for ARM Cortex-M4 microcontrollers, written by the author. The project is under development and new drivers will be added over time. Currently, it includes drivers for **GPIO**, **RCC (Reset and Clock Control)**, and controlling **Seven Segment Displays**.

## Requirements

- **ARM Cortex-M4 Microcontroller**
- **ARM Toolchain**: Ensure you have the necessary development tools installed, such as ARM GCC, and a compatible programmer/debugger (e.g., ST-Link).
- **IDE**: You can use IDEs that support ARM Cortex-M4 development, such as STM32CubeIDE, KEIL, or any compatible environment.

## Installation

1. Clone or download this repository.
2. Add the relevant files to your project directory.
3. Set up your development environment with the required toolchain for ARM Cortex-M4 and configure your IDE.

## Current Features

- **GPIO Driver**: Basic GPIO functionality for input/output pin configuration.
- **RCC Driver**: Control and configure the reset and clock for the microcontroller.
- **Seven Segment Display Driver**: Basic control to display numbers on a seven-segment display.

## Future Updates

This project is still under development, and more drivers will be added in the future to extend the functionality. These may include but are not limited to:

- Timer/Counter drivers
- ADC (Analog to Digital Converter) drivers
- UART (Universal Asynchronous Receiver/Transmitter) drivers
- PWM (Pulse Width Modulation) drivers
- And more...
